# Bon-Mappetit

The best way to share food you’ve enjoyed, and discover new food in your area.  Inspired by my move to NYC for the summer, users can upload a photo of food from a restaurant they've visited, along with a description and Google Places location.  The user is then redirected to the profile page, where the post is published, with a photo marker appearing on the Google Map.  In addition, users can discover new businesses by viewing other posts in the area by use of Google Maps.

Installation: 
+ clone this repo locally
+ cd into the backend file, and run 'bundle' in the terminal, and then run 'rails s'
+ cd into the frontend file, and run 'npm install && start'.  When asked if you want to run this in a different port, respond Y

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
