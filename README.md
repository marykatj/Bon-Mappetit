# Bon-Mappetit

The best way to share food youâ€™ve enjoyed, and discover new food in your area.  Inspired by my move to NYC for the summer, users can upload a photo of food from a restaurant they've visited, along with a description and Google Places location.  The user is then redirected to the profile page, where the post is published, with a photo marker appearing on the Google Map.  In addition, users can discover new businesses by viewing other posts in the area by use of Google Maps.
